  <div id="down" class="message">
    Hey love, itâ€™s okay to feel this way sometimes. Even the brightest stars need to rest behind the clouds. You're allowed to be sad, but never forget how strong, kind, and beautiful you are â€” inside and out.  
    Life can feel heavy, but Iâ€™m always here to carry some of that weight with you.  
    Take a breath. Drink some water. Let the world slow down.  
    Close your eyes and remember you are deeply loved.  
    Better days are coming â€” and youâ€™ve already survived so many storms.  
    Iâ€™m proud of you, always. ðŸ’œ  
  </div>

  <div id="happy" class="message">
    Ahh! You're feeling happy â€” and that fills my heart too! ðŸ¥¹âœ¨  
    I hope you're smiling wide, dancing around, or just soaking in the sunshine of this moment.  
    You deserve every bit of this joy, because you bring so much of it into the world.  
    Keep this feeling close, write it down if you can â€” so you can revisit it whenever you need a spark.  
    Iâ€™m celebrating with you in spirit â€” sending you high fives and hugs across the distance.  
    Let your heart shine. Your happiness is beautiful. ðŸŒžðŸ’›  
  </div>

  <div id="anxious" class="message">
    Breathe with me â€” slowly, in and out. ðŸŒ¿  
    Youâ€™re safe. This moment will pass. You donâ€™t need to solve everything right now.  
    I know your mind might feel like itâ€™s racing, but you have weathered this feeling before â€” and you will again.  
    Ground yourself â€” look at five things you can see, four things you can touch, three you can hear.  
    Let go of the pressure to be okay instantly. I am with you, no matter how heavy it feels.  
    You're not alone â€” and this feeling is not forever. One breath at a time, my love. ðŸ«¶  
  </div>

  <div id="confidence" class="message">
    Youâ€™ve got this. Seriously â€” read that again: **You. Have. Got. This.** ðŸ’ª  
    Iâ€™ve seen you do amazing things â€” and this is no different.  
    Doubts are normal, but they donâ€™t define you. You are capable, brilliant, and brave beyond measure.  
    Think of everything youâ€™ve overcome, how much youâ€™ve grown, how deeply you care.  
    That strength? Itâ€™s real. And itâ€™s yours.  
    Now go out there â€” not because you have to prove anything, but because you already shine. ðŸ’«  
    I believe in you â€” always.
